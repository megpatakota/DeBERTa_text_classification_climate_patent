A Python tool that uses **DeBERTa** for identifying **climate change mitigation technologies** from patent data, based on the **IPCC classification** system.

## Features

- Utilizes **DeBERTa** for advanced text classification of patent data
- Aligns patent data with the **IPCC** classification system for climate change mitigation technologies
- Processes large-scale patent datasets efficiently
- Provides model fine-tuning for domain-specific patent text

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies using **Poetry**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patent-classification-deberta.git
cd patent-classification-deberta
poetry install
